## Description

Note Taker is an application that provides the ability to read and write notes to a server hosted on Heroku.

## User Story

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a note-taking application:

- **Opening the Note Taker:** When I open the Note Taker, I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.

- **Entering a New Note:** When I enter a new note title and the note's text, a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.
- **Saving a New Note:** When I click on the Save icon, the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
- **Viewing an Existing Note:** When I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column.
